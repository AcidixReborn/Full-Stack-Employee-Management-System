# Full-Stack-Employee-Management-System
Project for designing, implementing, and testing a full-stack EMS. This will simulate backend dev tasks by incorporating route management, file handling, middleware integration, view rendering using EJS, and automated end-to-end testing with Cypress. Built a testable, modular, and maintainable sys using industry-standard tools.
